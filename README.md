Thyroiditis, 
Dermatitis, 
External otitis, 
Conjunctivitis, and 
Mastitis

_Note_: _We implemented our Chatbot in [MarkovML](https://www.markovml.com/) software, so this repo would also contain code of using the features like Experiment Tracking, and Model Recording._

We implemented NLU through RASA Framework,

DM through Rule Based Technique,
